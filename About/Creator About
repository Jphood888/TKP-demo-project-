      <p>
        Julian Prosper Pearse, widely recognized by his stage name <strong>Jphood</strong>, is a young innovator, actor, and musical artist who stands out for his creativity and vision. At just <strong>20 years old</strong>, during his final ND2 year, he launched the official mobile app for TIMEON KAIROS Polytechnic Institute as his school project — a bold and extraordinary move that speaks volumes about his ambition.
      </p>

      <p>
        Julian is not just a tech enthusiast — he's a proud student of the institution, with a heart for legacy. While others focused on theoretical projects, Julian decided to create something that would have a real and lasting impact: a functional app that connects students, showcases updates, and improves the school’s digital presence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside the classroom, Julian is deeply immersed in the creative arts. As an <strong>actor</strong> and musical <strong>artist</strong>, Jphood tells stories, performs music that resonates with youth, and brings his raw talent into every song and performance. He balances entertainment with a message, proving himself as more than just a student — but a full-blown creative force.
      </p>

      <p>
        His work reflects dedication, intelligence, and a desire to make his school proud. The TIMEON KAIROS App is more than a project — it’s a gift to the students, a solution to school challenges, and a record of what’s possible when passion meets action.
      </p>

      <p>
        From stage lights to coding nights, from music to innovation, Julian is setting a pace for others to follow.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “Julian is one of the few student developers redefining what it means to be a creative in Nigeria — blending tech, art, and school pride. His work on the TIMEON KAIROS app proves that you can be young, talented, and revolutionary all at once.”
